/// Service responsible for processing control plane stream events and device
///  tokens.
///
/// This service:
/// - Subscribes to the MeetingPlaceCoreSDK control plane stream and routes
/// events to domain
/// streams:
///   - onInvitationAccepted
///   - onGroupInvitationAccepted
///   - onConnectionOfferApproved
///   - onChannelInaugurated
/// - Registers the device push token with the SDK and triggers queued event
///   processing.
/// - Observes app lifecycle changes to trigger event processing on resume
///  (clears badges and processes events).
/// - Serializes control plane event processing to avoid concurrent runs.
///
/// The service exposes event streams that other services (ContactsService
/// , ConnectionsService) consume to create/update domain models and UI state
/// . It does not expose public mutation APIs;
/// it acts as an adapter between the SDK control plane feed,
/// push notifications, and app-level services.
